# Canopy

Canopy is an edge-optimized, distributed feature flag system designed for low-latency environments. It enables fine-grained feature control with dependency-based flag resolution and real-time synchronization.

## ðŸš€ Planned Features

### Core Functionality
- **Dependency-Based Flags** â€“ Flags can depend on other flags, ensuring hierarchical control.
- **Change History Without Hard Deletes** â€“ Flag changes are stored instead of hard deleting, allowing auditability.
- **Multi-Tenancy & Segmentation** â€“ Flags are scoped per project and environment (e.g., dev, staging, production).

### Edge Optimization
- **Edge Node Caching** â€“ Flags are cached locally with a configurable TTL.
- **Resilient Network Handling** â€“ Edge nodes serve cached flags during network partitions and refresh on reconnection.
- **Conflict Resolution** â€“ Nodes accept the latest event and resolve inconsistencies via CRDT-based mechanisms.

### Sync Mechanisms
- **Hybrid Sync Approach**
  - **Primary:** Phoenix.PubSub for real-time updates.
  - **Fallback:** Periodic polling in case of missed updates.

### API & Storage
- **PostgreSQL for Flag Storage** â€“ Ensures consistency and scalability.
- **ETS for Fast Caching** â€“ Optimized for quick lookups.
- **gRPC API for Flag Retrieval** â€“ High-performance client-server communication.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Status
ðŸš§ **Work in progress** â€“ Canopy is currently in early development. Features listed above are **planned** but not yet implemented.
